"""AGENT-GENERATED PAYMENTS demo — the two-event pattern + reconciliation.

The scenario: an agent decides on payments (deterministic rule engine),
a local provider responds (simulated — zero network, zero real money), and
every step is sealed into the journal. The two-event pattern requested by
the community (issue #3):

    policy_decision (allow/hold/deny + reason_code + policy_version)
    provider_response (provider status)
    ... linked by a correlation key: payment_intent_id

Then the two failure cases that exist in every real flow:
- the agent dies AFTER sealing the decision: decision without a response
- a retry skips the journaling step: an orphan response

And the caller-side reconciliation (the schema of the future plugin,
issue #3): pair by correlation key, journal the report as an event —
the journal's auditor is itself audited.

The whole payment flow is SYNTHETIC (payloads marked synthetic:true,
provider simulated) — but the journal is REAL: chained, signed, verifiable.
