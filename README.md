**Your AI agent writes meeting notes that bind your clients.
Eighteen months from now — who can prove what it *exactly* produced, and why?**
NoireBox seals every decision in a SHA-256 hash-chained + Ed25519-signed
journal, flags poisoned transcripts before they reach the agent, and exports
an attestation anyone can verify offline — **without trusting you**.

> **Works with any agent, in French and English.** The journal, the API, the
> MCP tools and the verifier are domain- and language-agnostic; each language
> gets a ~250 KB detector trained from a reproducible dataset (seed 42) — a new market =
> one dataset generator + `make train`. **Already have a guardrail? Keep it** —
> it's just another event source. 🇪🇺 Built for the
> [European market (GDPR & AI Act)](#built-for-the-european-market-gdpr--ai-act) — engineered in France.

## Built for the European market (GDPR & AI Act)

European AI vendors face a compliance reality their US competitors don't:
**proving** — not promising — what their systems did. NoireBox is engineered
around exactly that obligation.

| Requirement | How NoireBox answers |
|---|---|
| **GDPR art. 5(2)** — accountability: the controller must *demonstrate* compliance | Tamper-evident journal of what the AI produced, when, on which input |
| **GDPR art. 15/20** — data subject rights (access, portability) | Signed export of everything related to a meeting — verifiable *by the subject's own auditor* |
| **EU AI Act art. 12** — automatic event logging for risk systems | Every agent decision sealed at runtime; log integrity is cryptographic, not a promise |
| **DPIA / DPO workflows** | Attestation exportable for the DPO; incident taxonomy feeding risk documentation |
| **Sovereignty** | Self-hosted, no telemetry, no cloud dependency, Ed25519 keys stay on your infrastructure — deploys anywhere (including EU-only clouds) |

> **Honest scope** (we're a building block, not a certification): NoireBox
> proves the *integrity* of your AI's record. Data minimization of payloads
> and HSM-grade key storage are the deployer's responsibility in v0 — see
> the [threat model](docs/THREAT-MODEL.md). A tool that oversells compliance
> is a liability; one that states its perimeter is auditable.

## Why

- **GDPR**: a platform claiming "GDPR-compliant" must be able to demonstrate
  what its AI produced, on which data, and when.
- **EU AI Act (art. 12)**: risk systems must keep *automatic event logs*.
  Today, virtually every LLM stack logs for *debugging* — not for *proof*.
- The market gap: observability tools (Langfuse, LangSmith…) are built for
  devs, remain modifiable after the fact, and produce nothing presentable
  to an auditor, a DPO or a client.

## Honest positioning (state of the art)

| Tool | What it does | What it doesn't |
|---|---|---|
| Langfuse / LangSmith / Helicone | LLM observability, debugging, traces | No tamper-evident proof, nothing exportable for an audit |
| Garak / PyRIT / promptfoo | **offline** model-level red-teaming | No runtime guardrail, no proof journal |
| halo-record / gate-oc-audit | hash-chained journals for *coding* agents | No business domain, no third-party attestation, no French |
| **NoireBox** | **immutable Ed25519 journal → RFC 3161 anchoring → exportable attestation + standalone verifier** (bundled FR/EN guardrail = one pluggable event source; **fleet anchoring**: one TSA seal covers N journals) | — |

**NoireBox applies the Certificate-Transparency model to AI-agent journals:**
many journals, one root signed by a timestamp authority, inclusion proofs that
anyone verifies offline (`noirebox/merkle.py`, `make demo-fleet`). To our
knowledge, no other agent-audit tool does this.

## The core is the journal. The guardrail is a plugin.

![NoireBox architecture](docs/architecture.svg)

No ambiguity about what the product is:

- **One NoireBox per agent or service** — like one flight recorder per
  aircraft. One instance = one SQLite file, one key pair, one chain. The
  fleet layer (`noirebox/merkle.py`) aggregates **proofs** (32-byte chain
  heads), never events: your journal never leaves your infrastructure.
- **The journal is the product** — chain, signatures, append-only storage,
  RFC 3161 anchoring, export, standalone verifier. It is domain-agnostic,
  agent-agnostic and language-agnostic: an event is a free-typed `type`
  plus a payload, nothing more. `chain.py`/`store.py`/`anchors.py` import
  zero detection code — delete the whole guardrail and everything still runs.
- **Prevention is pluggable** — a guardrail is just one event producer
  among others. Already have Lakera, Llama Guard, your own LLM-judge, your
  own regexes? **Keep them.** Journal their verdicts the same way
  (`POST /api/v1/events`, `type: "incident"`) and their catches become
  tamper-evident and third-party verifiable instead of rewritable app logs.
- NoireBox ships a bundled guardrail (regex + trained ML) as a
  **working example of that plugin contract** — and as a convenience if you
  have none. It is swappable by design ([ADR 003](docs/ADRs.md)).

> Prevention varies per stack. Proof is universal.

## Quickstart

```bash
pip install noirebox   # the ML engine ships inside the wheel (FR + EN)
noirebox serve         # API on http://127.0.0.1:8768/docs
```

From source:

```bash
./start.sh          # venv + deps + tests + API on http://127.0.0.1:8768/docs
make demo           # the full story in one command (see below)
```

Or with Docker — no Python needed, the ML engine ships inside the image:

```bash
docker run -p 8768:8768 ghcr.io/slabbdev/noirebox:latest
# API + OpenAPI docs on http://127.0.0.1:8768/docs — data persists in ./data
```

Standalone demos:

```bash
make demo                # 100% real: micro-model → journal → auditor → caught pirate
make demo-mcp            # NoireBox as an MCP tool (agent protocol)
.venv/bin/python demo/demo_scan.py     # regex guardrail on 2 transcripts
.venv/bin/python demo/demo_tamper.py   # tampering → the chain explodes
```

Verify an export as a third party (auditor, DPO, client):

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8768/api/v1/export > export.json
.venv/bin/python verifier/verifier.py export.json   # exit 0 = chain intact
```

## Chain timestamping — the outside witness (RFC 3161)

The journal proves integrity, but *when* was it sealed? A server announcing
its own dates is the suspect writing its own report. And the threat model
had one open gap: an operator holding the private key could **regenerate the
whole chain** with valid signatures.

The anchor closes both. One call seals the current chain head with a TSA
(Timestamp Authority, RFC 3161): only the **32-byte hash** leaves (zero data,
zero GDPR exposure), the TSA signs *"I received hash X at time T"*, and the
token is journaled as an `anchor` event — the journal seals its own external
proof. A regenerated chain shows a head the old token doesn't cover: **caught
at verification time, without any prior external publication**.

```bash
make tsa                                    # local TSA: OpenSSL, own key, 0 €, works offline
NOIREBOX_TSA_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3318 ./start.sh
curl -X POST localhost:8768/api/v1/anchors  # seal the current head
```

TSA is a config choice, not a dependency: self-hosted OpenSSL for sovereign
deployments, any public or qualified TSA for production — same protocol.
Full story and visuals: [docs/VULGARISATION.md §9](docs/VULGARISATION.md),
decisions in [ADR 006/007](docs/ADRs.md).

## The bundled guardrail — one plugin, two engines

| Engine | Size | Languages | Role | Dependency |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `regex` | ~0 | FR+EN | obvious cases, zero cost | none |
| `ml` | 243–293 KB | **fr** & **en** (`lang` param) | paraphrases the regex misses, local | scikit-learn |

**Architecture decision — [ADR 002](docs/ADRs.md)**: we evaluated Meta's
Llama Prompt Guard 2 (the industry classifier, ~90 MB) and **rejected it
knowingly**: gated license, torch/transformers as dependencies, and binary
output without an audit taxonomy. The ADR also documents the **integration
path** if you ever need it (adapter ≈ 40 lines behind the same engine
interface). The tier-2 judge stays a local LLM (`llama-guard3:1b` via
Ollama) — same binary we already ship, zero new deps.

## The real LLM scene (local Ollama)

A **real LLM** (qwen2.5:0.5b, 397 MB, local via Ollama — never committed,
fetched by `ollama pull`) receives the poisoned transcript:

```bash
brew install ollama && ollama serve && ollama pull qwen2.5:0.5b   # once
make demo-llm                                                     # the scene
```

Measured outcome (temperature 0, reproducible):
- **Without NoireBox**: the model rewrites the attacker's instructions into
  "its" own summary — competitor's email and `DROP TABLE utilisateurs`
  included. The attack succeeds.
- **With NoireBox**: 4 poisoned lines removed *before* the call, incident
  sealed in the journal, and the model's real output is clean.

See also [deploy/DEPLOIEMENT.md](deploy/DEPLOIEMENT.md) for €0 deployment
(instant cloudflared tunnel, permanent Hugging Face Space) or a €3–6/mo VPS.

## The ML micro-detector — trained in-repo, two languages, ~250 KB each

```bash
make train        # FR: gen_dataset.py (5,400 examples) → detector.joblib
make train-en     # EN: gen_dataset_en.py (5,400 examples) → detector_en.joblib
```

A new language is a dataset, not a rewrite: the trainer, the registry and
the API (`lang: "fr" | "en"`) are shared. Adding Spanish = one
`gen_dataset_es.py` + `ml/train.py --lang es`.

**Honest evaluation** (the part that earns credit in reviews):
- the test sets share templates with their train sets → accuracy 1.000
  measures consistency, not generalization;
- the generalization proof lives elsewhere: **held-out sentences** (slang,
  typos, never-seen formulations) are frozen in `tests/test_ml_guardrail.py`
  — in *both* languages — correct category detected, **zero false positives**
  on trap-clean sentences ("send the report to the accountant", "I rotated
  my password");
- the EN held-out suite caught a real weakness in v1 ("take orders from
  me" scored 0.37) → dataset extended → model retrained → suite green.
  That loop *is* the ML workflow, and it's in the git history.

| Artifact | Size |
|---|---|
| `models/detector.joblib` + `models/detector_en.joblib` (versioned) | 293 + 243 KB |
| `data/dataset.jsonl` + `data/dataset_en.jsonl` (versioned) | ~1.3 MB |

## Plugging NoireBox in — 3 real ways

**1. REST** (any language):

```bash
curl -X POST https://noirebox.example.com/api/v1/transcripts/scan \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"meeting_id": "MTG-42", "text": "<transcript>", "engine": "ml"}'
```

**2. Python SDK** (`noirebox/client.py`):

```python
from noirebox.client import NoireBoxClient
nb = NoireBoxClient("https://noirebox.example.com")
nb.scan("MTG-42", transcript)          # guardrail before the agent
nb.log_event("llm_output", {...})      # seal the agent's output
nb.verify()                            # check the chain
```

**3. MCP** (the agent protocol — Claude Desktop and every MCP client):
4 tools exposed (`noirebox_scan`, `noirebox_log_event`, `noirebox_verify`,
`noirebox_attestation`). Config (`claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "noirebox": {
    "command": "/path/to/noirebox/.venv/bin/python",
    "args": ["-m", "noirebox.mcp_server"] } } }
```

Stdio JSON-RPC implementation with no external SDK: the protocol stays
readable end to end (`demo/demo_mcp.py`).

## Use cases — any agent that "decides"

| Agent | What NoireBox brings |
|---|---|
| Meeting assistant (demo scenario) | provable notes + transcript anti-injection |
| Coding agent | immutable journal of executed actions (files, commands) |
| AI customer support | proof of what was promised to the client, when and why |
| Legal / medical RAG pipeline | traceability of sources used and outputs produced |
| Business copilots (finance, HR…) | exportable attestation for internal audit / DPO / client |

The **journal** is universal (free-typed events). The shipped **guardrail
corpus** specializes in FR meeting transcripts — extending it to another
domain = adding examples to the dataset and re-running `make train`.

## API

| Route | Auth | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /api/v1/token` | — | Exchange `client_id`/`client_secret` for a 1 h JWT |
| `POST /api/v1/events` | 🔒 | Record an event (prompt, output, eval…) |
| `GET /api/v1/events` | 🔒 | Paginated event list |
| `GET /api/v1/verify` | open | Verify the chain in place |
| `POST /api/v1/transcripts/scan` | 🔒 | Guardrail: detect injections, journal the incident |
| `GET /api/v1/attestation` | open | Signed attestation of the current state |
| `GET /api/v1/attestation.pdf` | open | Attestation as a DPO-ready A4 PDF |
| `POST /api/v1/attestation/verify` | open | Verify a submitted attestation |
| `POST /api/v1/anchors` | 🔒 | RFC 3161 anchor: seal the current chain head with a TSA |
| `GET /api/v1/export` | 🔒 | Full auditable export |

🔒 = requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>` when `NOIREBOX_CLIENTS=id:secret,…`
is set; **verification routes stay open by design** — one never locks the
verification ([ADR 004](docs/ADRs.md)). Rate limit: 60 req/min per client.

## Bundled plugin — v0 attack taxonomy

- `instruction_override` — "ignore all instructions", "you are now…"
- `data_exfiltration` — "send … to email@… / https://…"
- `pii_request` — "give me the passwords / banking data"
- `tool_abuse` — "run DROP TABLE / rm -rf / curl"

See `corpus/attaques.json`. Extending = add regex patterns or dataset
examples, then `make train`.

## Tests

91 tests: cryptography (tampering, reordering, wrong key), regex and **ML
guardrails on held-out sentences in FR and EN**, API agent, MCP server, SDK
client against a **real uvicorn server** (ephemeral port), real LLM agent
(skipped if Ollama is absent — never simulated), **OAuth2 JWT auth + rate
limiting + DPO-ready PDF attestation + RFC 3161 anchoring against a real
local TSA (incl. the insider chain-regeneration attack)**, and the full
third-party verifier contract. Everything replays locally: `make test`
re-trains both language models and runs the full suite.
